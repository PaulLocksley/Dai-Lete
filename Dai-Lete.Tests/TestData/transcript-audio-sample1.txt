[Applause]
2:24
prime minister of seeking a call I am Mr
2:27
Speaker I seek leave to table an article
2:31
by Max Chandler Mather published in the
2:35
Jacobin magazine
2:37
in which he says consequently if the
2:40
greens were to waved through the Hat
2:42
bill it would foreclose on the
2:44
possibility of building the social and
2:46
political pressure needed to force the
2:49
government to take many full actions
2:52
and says
2:54
further allowing the half to pass would
2:57
demobilize the growing section of civil
3:00
society that is justifiably angry about
3:03
the degree of poverty and financial
3:05
stress that exists in such a wealthy
3:09
country and goes on to say Mr Speaker
3:13
while Parliament has debated the half
3:16
the greens have also launched a national
3:18
door knocking campaign targeted labor
3:21
Federal electorates Mr Speaker this
3:24
article this article a pope exposes the
3:29
political motive of the greens political
3:31
party and this member in opposing public
3:34
housing and and and and and makes it
3:38
very clear and I'm very happy to table
3:40
every word of it and I'd encourage
3:42
people in my electorate to read this
3:45
because it's an example of why you
3:47
should vote labor and never vote green
3:51
order
3:52
order
3:54
if members if members can leave the
3:57
chamber
